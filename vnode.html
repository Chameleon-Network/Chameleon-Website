		vNodes, or Virtual Nodes, are designed to run on VPS or server-grade hardware, offering the same functionality as pNodes to help route and secure transactions on the Chameleon Network. By incentivizing the community to operate vNodes, Chameleon Network aims to strengthen decentralization and enhance network security.<br/><br/>

		If you'd like to stay updated on the release of vNode incentives and learn how to participate, we encourage you to <a href="https://forum.chml.network/" target=_blank>sign up for an account</a> on our forum. Registered users will receive updates and announcements through our newsletter, so be sure to join the community and stay informed.<br/><br/>

		Once we launch the testnet, check back here for detailed instructions on how to set up and operate your own vNode to contribute to the Chameleon Network's decentralization efforts.
