		Network Nodes, also known as Highway Nodes, are essential for routing transactions across the Chameleon Network. Previously, these nodes were operated exclusively by the Incognito team, but Chameleon Network aims to promote decentralization by introducing incentives for the community to run their own nodes. This shift empowers users and strengthens the network's security and reliability.<br/><br/>

		If you'd like to stay updated on the release of Network Node incentives and learn how to participate, we encourage you to sign up for an account on our forum. Registered users will receive updates and announcements through our newsletter, so be sure to <a href="https://forum.chml.network/" target=_blank>join the community</a> to stay informed.<br/></br>

		Once we launch the testnet, check back here for detailed instructions on how to set up and operate your own Network Node to contribute to the Chameleon Network's decentralization efforts.
